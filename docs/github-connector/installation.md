## Overview

The GitHub Connector is a component which allows interaction with the GitHub API from inside of Kyma environment. The simplest way to install the GitHub Connector in Kyma is to install it as an addon.

## Installation in Kyma as an Addon

### Prerequisites

- Personal Access Token with desired privileges. To generate a new token, go [here](https://github.com/settings/tokens) or access **Personal access tokens** in the account through **Developer settings** in **Settings**. 
> **NOTE**: In case of generating token for an organization the [OAuth or Github App](https://developer.github.com/apps/) is needed.
- Access to the Kyma Console

> **NOTE**: It is best to create or use an additional service account (e.g. Your-Project-Name-Github-Connector) since any actions that the application performs are signed with the name of the user that the token belongs to.

### Steps

1. Add addons configuration to Kyma. Run:

    ``` shell
    cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
    apiVersion: addons.kyma-project.io/v1alpha1
    kind: ClusterAddonsConfiguration
    metadata:
      name: addons-slack-github-connectors
      finalizers:
      - addons.kyma-project.io
    spec:
      repositories:
        - url: github.com/kyma-incubator/hack-showcase//addons/index.yaml
    EOF
    ```

2. Go to the Namespace in which to install the Connector.
3. Find the addon in the Service Catalog and click it.
4. Click **Add** and select the installation plan. Fill in all required fields and click **Create Instance**.
5. Go to the **Services** tab in the Service Catalog. After provisioning and automatic registration of the Application resources, the Service Class of the GitHub Connector appears here.
6. Click the Service Class to enter its specification screen, click **Add once**, and then **Create Instance**.

To send requests to the GitHub API, bind the service you created to the Lambda Function.

### Verification

- To verify correct configuration, check if addons and Service instances in the **Instances** area of the Service Catalog have status **RUNNING**.
- Access **Webhooks**  in your GitHub repository or organization's **Settings** and verify that the webhook is **Active**.

### Removal

To correctly remove all GitHub Connector resources, you must delete them in order reverse to the installation steps.
> **CAUTION:** Wait until deprovisioning and removing of all elements is complete before proceeding to the next step to avoid possible errors. For example, after removing ServiceClass, the removal of ServiceInstance is impossible.

1. Delete all service bindings from Lambda Functions and other bindings connected with your GitHub Connector Service Instance.
2. Delete the GitHub Connector Service Instance found under the **Services** tab in the **Instances** area.
3. Delete the GitHub Connector addon Instance found in the **Add-Ons** tab.
4. To remove the addon configuration, find it in the global **Add-Ons Config** catalog and remove it.
   > **CAUTION**: This step also removes the Slack Connector template.

## Installation in Kyma with Helm

### Prerequisites

- Connection to Kyma cluster
- The GitHub Connector Docker image
- Personal access token

### Steps

1. Go to the [Kyma repository](https://github.com/kyma-project/kyma) and run the script `/installation/scripts/tiller-tls.sh` to get the certificates needed to use Helm commands. By default, they are stored in the `~/.helm` directory. After that, add the `--tls` flag to every Helm command to authorize and authenticate the user.
2. Go to the `chart/githubconnector` directory. Run this command to install the GitHub Connector:

    ``` shell
    helm install --set container.image={DOCKER_IMAGE} --set kymaAddress={KYMA_ADDRESS} --set githubURL={GITHUB_REPO_URL} --set githubToken={GITHUB_TOKEN} -n {RELEASE_NAME} . --tls
    ```

    >**CAUTION:** Make sure the Kyma address is in the correct format. It consists of the domain name and cannot begin with the dot. For example, `35.187.32.214.xip.io`.

    >**NOTE:** To define the Namespace in which to install the chart, add the `--namespace` flag to the command. To define the GitHub URL, add the `--set githubURL` flag. To create a webhook on one repository, use the construction `repos/:owner/:repo`. To create a webhook on the whole organization, use `orgs/:org`. To provide the security token, use the `--set githubToken` flag.

If you want to add a new repository after the installation, see the [manual configuration page](/docs/github-connector/manual_connection.md).
