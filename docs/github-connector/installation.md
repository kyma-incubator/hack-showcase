## Overview

The GitHub Connector is a component which allows interaction with GitHub API from inside of Kyma environment. The simplest way to install GitHub Connector in Kyma is to install it as an Add-On.

## Installation in Kyma as an Add-On

### Prerequisites

- GitHub App with desired privileges installed to destination repository or organization. To create a new application, go [here](https://github.com/settings/apps) or access *Github Apps* in the account through *Settings* in *Developer settings*.
- Access to Kyma Console

> **NOTE**: It is best to create or use additional service account (e.g. Your-Project-Name-Github-Connector) since any actions performed by this application are signed with the name of the user that the token belongs to.

> **OPTIONAL:** Install default application following these steps, but pay attention to the fact that it has **full permissions** in repository/organization.
>
> 1. Go to the [authentication page](https://auth-github-connector.herokuapp.com/). Click **GitHub** button which redirects you to another page. Select repositories or organizations you want to install the application to and click **Install**.
>       - **NOTE:** If the link does not work, see [this tutorial](https://developer.github.com/apps/quickstart-guides/setting-up-your-development-environment/#step-2-register-a-new-github-app) in the GitHub documentation to create your own application.
> 2. Copy the Authentication Token. You will need it later in the installation process.

### Steps

1. In Kyma console access the **Add-Ons Config** menu.
2. Click **Add New Configuration** and specify the URL of the repository with GitHub Connector Add-On.

   ```http
   github.com/kyma-incubator/hack-showcase//addons
   ```

3. Go to namespace in which you want to install the Connector.
4. Find the Add-On in Service Catalog and click it.
5. Click **Add** and select the installation plan. Fill in all required fields and click **Create Instance**.
6. Go to **Services** tab of Service Catalog. After provisioning and automatic registration of application's resources the Service Class of GitHub Connector can be found here.
7. Click it to enter its specification screen and click **Add once** and then **Create Instance**.

After the service is created it can be easily bound to Lambda Function to allow use of GitHub Events.

### Verification

- To verify if everything is configured correctly check if Add-Ons and Service instances in **Instances** area of Service Catalog have status <span style="color:green">*RUNNING*</span>.
- Check in your GitHub repository's or organization's *Settings/Webhooks* if the webhook is <span style="color:green">*Active*</span>.

### Removal

Basically, to correctly remove all resources of GitHub Connector you must delete them in order reverse to installation steps.
> **NOTE:** Wait until deprovisioning and removing of all elements is complete before proceeding to next step, because e.g. after removing ServiceClass removal of ServiceInstance is impossible.

1. Delete all service bindings from Lambda Functions and other bindings connected with your GitHub Connector Service Instance.
2. Delete GitHub Connector Service Instance found under **Services** tab in **Instances** area.
3. Delete GitHub Connector Add-On Instance found in **Add-Ons** tab.
4. To remove the Add-On Configuration, find it in the global **Add-Ons Config** catalog and remove it.
   > **CAUTION**: This step also removes the Slack Connector template.

## Installation in Kyma with Helm

### Prerequisites

- Connection to Kyma cluster
- The GitHub Connector Docker image

### Steps

1. Go to [Kyma repository](https://github.com/kyma-project/kyma) and run script `/installation/scripts/tiller-tls.sh` to get certificates needed for using Helm commands. By default they are stored in `~/.helm` directory. After that add the `--tls` flag to every Helm command to authorize and authenticate a user.
2. Go to the `chart/githubconnector` directory. Run this command to install the GitHub Connector:

    ``` shell
    helm install --set container.image={DOCKER_IMAGE} --set kymaAddress={KYMA_ADDRESS} --set githubURL={GITHUB_REPO_URL} --set githubToken={GITHUB_TOKEN} -n {RELEASE_NAME} . --tls
    ```

    >**CAUTION:** Make sure the Kyma address is in the correct format. It consists of the domain name and cannot begin with the dot. For example, `35.187.32.214.xip.io`.

    >**NOTE:** To define the Namespace in which to install chart, add the flag `--namespace`. To define the GitHub URL, add the flag `--set githubURL`. If you want to crate webhook on one repository use construction `repos/:owner/:repo`. if you want create webhook on whole organization you have to use `orgs/:org`. To provide security token use flag `--set githubToken`.

3. For further steps see [configuration page](/docs/github-connector/configuration.md)
