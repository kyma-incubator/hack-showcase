## Overview

The Slack Connector is a component which allows interaction with Slack API from inside of Kyma environment. The simplest way to install Slack Connector in Kyma is to install it as Add-On.

## Installation in Kyma as Add-On

### Prerequisites

- Slack Application with desired privileges installed to destination workspace. Tutorial provided by Slack on how to setup an application can be found [here](https://api.slack.com/bot-users).
- Access to Kyma cluster console.

### Steps

1. In Kyma console access the **`Add-Ons Config`** menu.
2. Click **`+ Add New Configuration`** and specify the URL of the repository with Slack Connector Add-On.

   ```url
   github.com/kyma-incubator/hack-showcase//addons
   ```

3. Go to namespace in which you want to install the Connector.
4. Find the Add-On in Service Catalog and click it.
5. Click **`Add`** and select the installation plan. Fill in all required fields and click **`Create Instance`**.
6. Go to **Services** tab of Service Catalog. After provisioning and automatic registration of application's resources the Service Class of Slack Connector can be found here.
7. Click it to enter its specification screen and click **`Add once`** and then **`Create Instance`**.

After the service is created it can be easily bound to Lambda Function to allow use of Slack Events and Web API.

### Verification

To verify if everything is configured correctly check if Add-Ons and Service instances in **Instances** area of Service Catalog have status RUNNING.

### Removal

Basically, to correctly remove all resources of Slack Connector you need to delete them in order reverse to installation steps.
> **NOTE:** Wait until deprovisioning and removing of all elements is completed before moving to next step.

1. Delete all service bindings from Lambda Functions and other bindings connected with your Slack Connector Service Instance.
2. Delete Slack Connector Service Instance found under **Services** tab in **Instances** area.
3. Delete Slack Connector Add-On Instance found in **Add-Ons** tab.
4. If you want to remove add-on configuration, you can remove Add-Ons Configuration from global **Add-Ons Config** Catalog, but this removes *GitHub Connector* alongside.

## Installation in Kyma with Helm

### Prerequisites

- Connection to Kyma cluster
- Slack Connector Docker image

### Steps

1. Go to the [authentication page](https://auth-slack.herokuapp.com/). Click `Add to Slack`. This redirects you to another page. Select your desired workspace and click `Allow`.
    >**NOTE:** If the link does not work, it means that an application that authenticates the connector in your workspace does not exist and you have to create it yourself. To create such an application, see [this tutorial](https://api.slack.com/docs/oauth#flow) in the Slack API documentation.

2. Copy the authentication token. You will need it later in the Helm command.
3. Go to [Kyma repository](https://github.com/kyma-project/kyma) and run the script `/installation/scripts/tiller-tls.sh` to get certificates needed for using Helm commands. By default they are stored in `~/.helm` directory. After that add `--tls` flag to every Helm command to authorize and authenticate the user.
4. Go to the `chart/slackconnector` directory. Run this command to install the Slack Connector:

    ``` shell
    helm install --set container.image={DOCKER_IMAGE} --set kymaAddress={KYMA_ADDRESS} --set slackBotToken={SLACK_TOKEN} -n {RELEASE_NAME} . --tls
    ```

    >**CAUTION:** Make sure that the Kyma address is in the correct format. It consists of the domain name and omits the dot at the beginning. For example, `35.187.32.214.xip.io`.
    >**NOTE:** To define Namespace in which chart should be installed add flag `--namespace`.
